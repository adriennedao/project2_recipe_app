# Rubric
## Technical Requirements
Progressing - Not all of the CRUD functionality is fully functional for this application. I tried to edit an ingredient and received an error. I think you're pretty close to solidifying this, but I would do some error handling for all the base functionality for this app.

## Creativity/Interface
Progressing - Not too much in the way of styles yet. The app is also essentially just standard CRUD. I would encourage you to make this app your own and customize so of the base functionality of a CRUD application.

## Code Quality
Progressing - The code quality isn't formatted correctly in most places. Also I would comment on code that you felt was challenging during this process.

## Functionality
Progressing - Many parts of the app are functional. However, it is missing some of the core essentials for the CRUD functionality of this application.
